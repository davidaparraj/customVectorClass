# Custom Vector Class (C++)

## Overview
This project implements a **custom dynamic array class** in C++ that replicates the core functionality of `std::vector` without using the standard library implementation.  
The goal was to strengthen understanding of **object-oriented programming**, **memory management**, and **algorithm design** through manual implementation.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic resizing** with heap memory management  
- **Python-style negative indexing** for reverse access to elements  
- **Templates for generic programming** to support multiple data types  
- **`remove_dups()`** method to eliminate duplicate elements  
- **Custom sorting method** for arranging elements in ascending order  
- Operator overloading for intuitive element access and assignment (To be finished)
- Comprehensive testing through multiple insertion, deletion, and traversal cases

---

## Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Design (encapsulation, constructors, destructors)
- Memory allocation (`new` / `delete`)
- Data structure manipulation
- Template programming and reusability
